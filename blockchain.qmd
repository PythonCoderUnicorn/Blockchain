# Blockchain 101

Blockchain is all about decentralization, which is used in **web3** technology.

- **Blockchain** = a network of computers all hosting, maintaining and creating new "blocks" pf data that are all chained together using cryptography 
(which is a immutable ledger). 

- **Consensus Mechanism** = the mechanism by which all the different computers in the blockchain network, nodes, come to agree on what data the ledger contains.

- **PoW** = proof of work consensus mechanism, Bitcoin consenus mechanism.
Computers doing a massive amout of cryptographic work in order to potentially win a chance at mining the next block, earning a block reward. 

- **PoS** = proof of stake consensus mechanism, Etherium's consensus mechanism.
Participants staking their tokens, native currency of the network in exchange for a chance to mine the next block , earning a reward. 

- **Dapp** = decentralized app, piece of software that has at least some decentralized component. 

- **layers** = different blockchains and systems that run on top of a base blockchain in order to unlock or improve existing functionality that may not be possible on the base layer.


## Blockchain uses

Everything is transparent, verifiable, and decentralized.

- money
- smart contracts
- DeFi (decentralized finance)
- NFT (non-fungible tokens)
- DAO (decentralized autonomous org)

**Smart contracts** are pieces of code that are deployed to the blockchain via a ledger system. Like a Bitcoin transaction, smart contract code gets deployed and recorded to the blockchain for all to see forever. 



## Decentralization 

In a decentralized (or distributed) system, the code is running across a collection of computers all owned by individual entities. This network is usually open for anyone to join and participate in running a node.

A peer-2-peer network is a collection of different people running file hosting servers. With this model, if we want to download a file, we can download it from any of the servers in the network that host it. 
P2P networks are ephemeral and don’t have a global state record, whereas blockchains do.



## Usefulness/ Benefits

- security = security from the cryptography and generating secure
identity and suer management

- transparency = blockchains are open (open network, open nodes where verification takes place == decentralized)

- permanence = ledgers in the blockchain are permanent


> in blockchain, we don't want duplicated transactions, hence the sitributed ledger (network wide)



## Blockchain Anatomy

Each blockchain network works a bit differently PoW vs PoS. 
Blockchain functionality is blocks, nodes, and miners. 

### Blocks

blocks are the chunks of data that make up the blockchain.
A blockchain as a chain of blocks of data connected to each 
other via their timestamps and hashes of their data.

- `data` = data contained in and written to the block
- `nonce` = a randomly generated 32-bit integer that makes a block header hash
- `hash` = a 256-but integer that is connected to the nonce

1. blockchain created
2. nonce generates a hash


### Nodes

Nodes must have the ledger watched and verified by copious distributed computers,
each computer is a `node`. Nodes only hold a copy of the existing blockchain, miners are the ones who add blocks.

- Each node is responsible for independently approving each new block that gets mined. - The whole network of nodes must approve a block for it to be successfully mined. 

### Miners

Miners are in charge of creating new blocks on the blockchain. 
Every block has its own nonce and hash, but every block also 
references the previous block’s hash. 

PoW system: mining is using software to brute frce guess the correct nonce to match the correct hash, going through 4 billion permutations. Finding the correct nonce == 'proof of work'.

When miners submit a nonce, it gets run through a cryptography function that will output a hash. Only when a miner gets the hash correct do they get to mine the next block.
